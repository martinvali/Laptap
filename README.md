# Laptap

Laptap was a student company which I was part of.

In order to maximize sales, I undertook the challenge of developing a website for our company.

Over the course of 1 year, we managed to sell a total of 17 laptop stands through the website, which accounted for roughly half of our total sales. Therefore the website played a major role in our sales strategy.
